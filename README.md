# Inhibition in Natural Gas Pipeline
A software programmed in python to calculate the amount of inhibitor required for depression in freezing point of the Natural Gas to the required extent so that the Hydrate formation doesn't occur inside the pipeline.
The absence of any online or offline tool to predict the hydrate formation temperature and water content in natural gas or hydrate became the cornerstone behind the development of this project.
